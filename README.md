# TSP Genetic Algorithm Project Proposal

## Executive Summary
This proposal outlines the development of a Windows Forms application that demonstrates the genetic algorithm approach to solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The application will provide an interactive visualization platform with real-time feedback and adjustable parameters to explore genetic algorithm performance for combinatorial optimization.

## Problem Statement
The Traveling Salesman Problem is a classic NP-hard optimization problem: given a set of cities and the distances between them, find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city. This problem has significant applications in logistics, circuit design, and transportation planning.

## Project Objectives
- Implement a genetic algorithm to find near-optimal solutions for the TSP  
- Create an interactive visualization showing the evolution process in real-time  
- Provide a user interface for adjusting algorithm parameters  
- Demonstrate the effectiveness of evolutionary approaches for complex optimization problems  
- Track and display performance metrics to evaluate algorithm efficiency  

## Technical Approach

### PEAS Framework Analysis

#### Performance Measure
- **Primary:** Shortest tour length (lower is better)  
- **Secondary:**
  - Number of generations to reach solution  
  - Computation time  
  - Improvement percentage from initial random solution  
  - Memory usage efficiency  

#### Environment
- Set of cities with (x, y) coordinates in 2D space  
- Distance metrics between cities (Euclidean)  
- User interface control parameters  
- Visualization panel  
- System resources (CPU, memory)  

#### Actuators
- Generate and modify population of candidate solutions  
- Apply selection methods (tournament selection)  
- Perform crossover operations (ordered crossover)  
- Apply mutation operations (swap mutation, 2-opt)  
- Display current and best paths  
- Update statistics and visualization  
- Respond to user control inputs  

#### Sensors
- Fitness evaluation mechanism (distance calculation)  
- Generation counter  
- Timer for computation time measurement  
- User parameter inputs (sliders, buttons)  
- Current population state  
- Best solution tracking

### ODESDA Environment Properties Analysis

| Property               | Type                                                                 |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Observable**         | Fully Observable: All city positions, solutions, and fitness values |
| **Deterministic**      | Mostly Deterministic with stochastic elements for variation         |
| **Episodic**           | Sequential: Each generation depends on the previous one             |
| **Static**             | Static problem (city positions fixed), with dynamic user parameters |
| **Discrete**           | Discrete cities, paths, and generations                             |

#### Agent Type
- **Single-agent:** One genetic algorithm solver  
- **Multi-agent perspective:** Each individual solution in the population acts like a competing agent
